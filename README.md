## Prerequisites

In order to run the backend api for frontend you're requried to have ruby. You can find ruby documentation to install here (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

## Getting Started
Before cloning, clone the backend api first made with Ruby on Rails
### `git clone https://github.com/cejimenez0123/myApp-backend.git`

### `git clone https://github.com/cejimenez0123/myapp-frontend.git`

Once you've cloned both repositories run bundle install on backend and npm install on frontend in order to have necessary dependencies. Once done, start the backend server up first with 'rail s'. Make sure it is running on port 3000. Then start the front end server with 'npm start'
